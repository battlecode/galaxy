        Attempt to finalize the rating for this participation if ready.

        Ratings are a complex affair. Ideally, we would like to update ratings as soon
        as we find out the result of a match. However, for user experience reasons,
        matches should have their ratings applied in the order they are listed to the
        client, which is in order of match creation (this ensures that matches do not
        spontaneously shuffle). This is usually different to the order of match
        completion.

        Therefore, we backlog rating updates when they come out of order, and finalize
        as many ratings as we can each time. A participation can have its rating
        finalized if the team's previous participation (if any) is already finalized,
        and if the match is either complete or unranked. After the update, any
        newly-finalizable participations are also finalized.

        Note that teams with no prior participations are assumed to have the
        default-constructed rating.
