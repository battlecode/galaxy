      content="MIT Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an autonomous player.
    Your AI player will need to strategically manage a robot army and control how your robots work together to defeat the enemy team.
    As a contestant, you will learn to use artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and communications to make
    your player as competitive as possible. Battlecode is open to anyone, however tournaments may limit who can receive a prize."
