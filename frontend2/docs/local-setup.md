# Local Setup Instructions

## One-Time Setup

First, make sure you have **prepared your Conda environment, according to the top-level readme.**

Then, run

```
npm install
```

## Running

Make sure that the backend is running. (You can hook up to a deployed backend, or run it locally. Then make sure `.env.development` points to that backend.)

In **this directory**, run:

```
npm run start
```

This automatically reloads the page on changes.
