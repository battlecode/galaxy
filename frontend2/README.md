# Battlecode Frontend

The new and improved frontend, for the Battlecode competitor portal.

<!-- TODO like with previous frontend, this should have some direct links to docs, and maybe some outline content
Maybe sketch now, and open a new issue to fill in later? -->

## Codebase Intro

See [docs/onboard.md](docs/onboard.md) for an introduction to the frontend codebase, in order to make changes. This is helpful not only for frontend devs themselves but also for **just a working knowledge of frontend features, even if you're not a frontend dev!**
