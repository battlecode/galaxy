    <title>Battlecode Dashboard</title>

    <!--     
    From Nathan, who spent hours trying to clean the frontend and running smack into this:

    light-bootstrap-dashboard is a _huge_ HTML/CSS/JS package from Creative Tim.
    It has dependencies on really old versions of bootstrap, jquery, etc.
    Because of this, if you try to add newer versions of bootstrap, then things break.
    If you even try to change the version of bootstrap that light-boostrap-dashboard uses,
    things also break since the versions conflict.
    So _we're stuck using a very old version of bootstrap._ We have a similar problem for jquery.

    If you want to redesign the frontend, you have a few options:
    1a Clear out the light-bootstrap-dashboard theme, and theme things you (Optionally, upgrade Bootstrap, jquery, etc.)
       Then you'll have to theme things yourself. **This will take lots of effort, and knowledge of CSS.**
       But it'll be much much easier to maintain, which is great for dev turnover and needing less skill overall.
       (Less boilerplate of light-bootstrap-dashboard that we won't use; more knowledge of our own code.)
    2 Use all the pieces we already have, including the light-bootstrap-dashboard theme, old bootstrap, etc.
      You'll be able to make something, and it'll be a quicker process. But you may have less flexibility, 
      or run into errors from using obsolete things. It'll also be much less maintainable.
