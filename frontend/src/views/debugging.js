          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The “Frames” tab, which shows all the methods that have been
              called to get to where we are. (You can ignore the methods below
              “run”; they're battlecode magic.)
            </li>
            <li>
              The “Variables” tab, which shows the values of variables that are
              currently available.
            </li>
            <li>
              A line of icons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  “Step over”, which goes to the next line in the current file,
                  ignoring any methods you call.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Step into”, which goes into whatever method you call next.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Force step into”, which does the same thing as Step into, but
                  also shows you inscrutable JVM internals while it goes. You
                  shouldn't need this.
                </li>
                <li>“Step out”, which leaves the current method.</li>
                <li>
                  “Drop Frame”, which pretends to rewind, but doesn't really.
                  Don't use this unless you know what you're doing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Run to Cursor”, which runs until the code hits the line the
                  cursor is on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Evaluate Expression”, which lets you put in any code you want
                  and see what its value is.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The “Threads” tab, which you shouldn't mess with, because you
              might break the server.

                    Using a “debugger” lets you pause your code while its
                    running and inspect its state - what your variables are set
                    to, what methods you're calling, and so on. You can walk

                    Battlecode supports “remote debugging”, which means that you
                    start up the battlecode server and tell it to pause, then
                    connect to it with Eclipse or Intellij. It's easy to set up.

                    Following this guide, you'll be able to view the game in the
                    client as you are debugging. Just keep the client open and
                    the game should automatically play (up until your
                    breakpoint).

                  <h5 id="debugging-vocabulary">Debugging vocabulary</h5>
                  <p>Debugging has some new words that you might not know:</p>
                  <p>
                    A <strong>debugger</strong> is a tool that runs your code
                    and pauses when you tell it to. You'll be using Eclipse or
                    Intellij as a debugger for battlecode (unless you're
                    particularly hardcore.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A <strong>breakpoint</strong> is an automatic pause point in
                    the code. When the debugger gets to that line of code, it
                    will pause, and wait for you to tell it what to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Stepping</strong> is telling the debugger to take a
                    single “step” in the code, and then pause again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can also <strong>resume</strong> code, to keep running
                    until you hit another breakpoint.
                  </p>

                    The <strong>stack</strong> and <strong>stack frames</strong>{" "}
                    are fancy words for, basically, the list of methods that are
                    currently being called. So, if you have the methods:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
                    <code>
                      void doSomething() {"{"}
                      goSomewhere();
                      {"}"}
                      void goSomewhere() {"{"}
                      goLeft();
                      {"}"}
                      void goLeft() {"{"}
                      rc.move(LEFT);
                      {"}"}
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    And you call <code>doSomething()</code>, the stack will look
                    like:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
                    <code>
                      {" "}
                      ... ^ rc.move(LEFT) ^ goLeft() ^ goSomewhere() ^
                      doSomething(){" "}
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                  <p>If you have questions, ask in IRC.</p>
                  <h5 id="starting-the-server-in-debug-mode">
                    Starting the server in debug mode
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Do{" "}
                    <code>
                      ./gradlew runDebug -PteamA=examplefuncsplayer
                      -PteamB=examplefuncsplayer -Pmaps=FourLakeLand
                    </code>{" "}
                    in a terminal. (Or equivalent, for the teams and maps you
                    want.) (This works exactly like <code>./gradlew run</code>.)
                    If you're in IntelliJ, you can just run the{" "}
                    <code>runDebug</code> Gradle task there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It should say{" "}
                    <code>
                      Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
                    </code>{" "}
                    and pause.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that the server has started, and is waiting for
                    the Eclipse or IntelliJ debugger to connect.
                  </p>
                  <p>(You have to do this every time you want to debug.)</p>

                    This method probably does not allow you to view the game in
                    the client at the same time. We recommend following the
                    instructions above.

                    Add the gradle run task as a configuration
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        In the dropdown near the hammer, play, and bug icons,
                        select <code>edit configurations</code>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hit the plus and select <code>gradle</code>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Give the configuration a name, e.g. "RunBattlecode"
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Next to the <code>gradle project</code> field, click the
                        folder icon and select{" "}
                        <code>{this.state.scaffoldName}</code>

                      <li>
                        In the <code>Tasks</code> field, type <code>run</code>

                      <li>
                        Click <code>Apply</code>, <code>Ok</code>

                    When your configuration is selected from the dropdown menu,
                    clicking play will run the game, the same way double
                    clicking run in the gradle window does. Clicking on the bug
                    icon next to the play button will run the game in debug mode
                    in the ide. Use breakpoints and the debuging interface to
                    walk through your code. For more info on debugging with
