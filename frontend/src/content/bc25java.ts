    `,
  "Tournament Format": `
Each match within a tournament will consist of at least 3 games, each on a different map, and the team that wins the most games will advance.

Scrimmage rankings will be used to determine seeds for all tournaments. Ties will be broken by Sprint tournament rankings.

Tournaments will be in a double elimination format, with the exception of both Sprint Tournaments, which are single elimination. The Final Tournament will start with a blank slate (any losses from the Qualifying Tournament are reset).

Even if you miss earlier tournaments, you can participate in later tournaments (except the Final Tournament). This includes the Qualifying Tournament â€” you can participate even if you miss every other tournament (your seed will be determined by your scrimmage rank).
    `,
  "Eligibility Rules": `
Anyone can write a bot, create a team, and participate in scrimmage matches/rankings. The Sprint Tournaments are open to everyone, but the other tournaments have stricter eligibility rules.

Your team must meet **all three conditions** by a tournament's submission deadline to be eligible for it:

1. Have uploaded a bot
2. Have correctly indicated your eligibility on your Team Profile page
