# Battlecode Frontend

Fully static frontend in React, based on `battlecode19/app`, using modified template from http://creative-tim.com.

**I would strongly recommend -- if not mandate -- that you read over this page, in full, before doing any frontend work.**

## Development Workflow

See [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md) for an idea of how to do work as part of the frontend team. **Read this page entirely before proceeding with work!**

## Local Setup Instructions

See [docs/local-setup.md](docs/local-setup.md) to set up a working frontend on your machine for development, or if you have issues in that setup.

## Codebase Intro

(TODO note that even if you're working on backend and just need a "working knowledge of frontend dev" hit here)

GDoc or markdown? gdoc allows for more formatting but markdown-in-repo is here for consistency, etc....
gonna try md in repo
screenshots / code snippets are gonna be hecka tiring

TODO some codebase intro, both about react and about our code in particular

React "intro" -- discuss core principles of react and the useful bits
components
api
state and refresh

End-user guide: what does frontend even do?

Talk about our own pages. what is it? what's the end result / what does it do? And then, the technical detail of howwww
index first, and expand that,
then routes too.
components
the third-party stuff.
Then hit API
API !!
how does backend link?
ajax? jquery? at least links

Discuss technical parts w enough to get people started or reduce confusion
like just enough intro to get new devs started
not too much detail (for now) -- I can add more as it comes. or maybe a laundry list later (or more pages or etc)

Motivate enough to give people an idea of what use cases are like, for support for backend/infra/etc
separate formatting for separate audiences? separate formatting for technical detail

## Deployment
