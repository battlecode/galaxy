# Battlecode Frontend

Fully static frontend in React, based on `battlecode19/app`, using modified template from http://creative-tim.com.

**I would strongly recommend -- if not mandate -- that you read over this page, in full, before doing any frontend work.**

## Development Workflow

See [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md) for an idea of how to do work as part of the frontend team. **Read this page entirely before proceeding with work!**

## Local Setup Instructions

See [docs/local-setup.md](docs/local-setup.md) to set up a working frontend on your machine for development, or if you have issues in that setup.

## Codebase Intro

See [docs/onboard.md](docs/onboard.md) for an introduction to the frontend codebase, in order to make changes. **If you just need a working knowledge of frontend features / development / etc, start here!** (for example, if you're a backend dev but need to know some desired features for frontend)

## Deployment

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) to learn how to deploy changes.
