## Codebase Intro

See [docs/onboard.md](docs/onboard.md) for an introduction to the frontend codebase, in order to make changes. **If you just need a working knowledge of frontend features / development / etc, start here!** (for example, if you're a backend dev but need to know some desired features for frontend)

This also contains many notes, tips, and tricks about the technical details.

## Deployment

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) to learn how to deploy changes.
