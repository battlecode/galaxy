## Add a dev to any team

This enables lots of cool technical support things. Most notably, **this is the (currently) "unofficial-official" way to view and download a team's submissions and replays**, which is helpful in debugging.

## Resetting people's passwords

Sometimes, password resets don't go through, since users never get the emails, due to issues with our email backend. No email backend will ever be failproof, so here are some other methods:

- Have users switch to a different email address, with which that they can receive emails from our backend. You can make this switch in the admin panel. Then, have them request a new password through the normal means.

## Administering Backend Emails through Mailjet

If automated emails from the backend server stop sending, or if you have other issues with these emails, see [emails.md](the emails readme). Feel free to add any new notes there too!
