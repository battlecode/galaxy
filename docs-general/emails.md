# Emails

## Mailing Lists

Battlecode maintains various email lists of competitors each year, as well as a general interest list. These lists are generally administered by presidents or directors of operation (although webinfra devs may certainly help with these tasks). More information and instructions about these lists can be found in our Google Drive.

However, sets of competitor emails are derived from our backend, and so it is webinfra's job to produce these. To do this: 

- Go to the admin panel, go to the `users` page, then click `export as csv`
- Then, format this as needed with your favorite csv editor (even Google Sheets is fine).
 - If you are formatting for the `mmblanche` tool, you can also the automated script that is coming soon as tracked in [https://github.com/battlecode/galaxy/issues/500](#500).
