Future Battlecode monorepo (will contain competitor dashboard backend/frontend and saturn)

## Siarnaq (backend)

TODO: In the future, maybe move this part of the readme to the backend folder.

### Setup

Install Conda and Python (what versions? @jerry)

Run `conda env create -n siarnaq -f environment-dev.yml` to set up the Conda environment.

Run `pre-commit install` to set up checks that run before each commit. 

### Development

Run `conda activate siarnaq` to activate the environment before beginning development (is this how it works @jerry)
