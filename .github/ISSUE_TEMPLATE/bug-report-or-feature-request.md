Although not required, these would be great if you can:

- [ ] Assign a label for priority. (the red labels. or if you don't know the priority, "triage", the black label)
- [ ] Assign a label (or labels) for module. (the green labels)
- [ ] Assign a label (or labels) for type. (the yellow labels)
- [ ] If this is a simple issue or fix, assign "good first issue". (the blue label)

When you're done with each item, you can delete the template's text!
